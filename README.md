🌲🔥 Algerian Forest Fire Prediction 🔥🌲

📌 Overview

Algerian Forest Fire Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to predict the likelihood of forest fires in Algeria based on environmental factors. By leveraging advanced machine learning models, this project helps in taking preventive measures and ensuring early fire detection to protect forests and wildlife. 🌍🌿

🚀 Features

✅ Predicts fire occurrence based on environmental data 📊
✅ Uses machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions 🤖
✅ Dataset sourced from Algerian forest regions 🌎
✅ Provides visual insights into fire patterns 🔥
✅ Helps in making data-driven decisions for fire prevention 🛑

📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of meteorological and environmental factors that influence forest fires in Algeria. Key attributes include:

🌡️ Temperature (°C)

💨 Relative Humidity (%)

🌬️ Wind Speed (km/h)

☀️ Rainfall (mm)

🔥 Fire Occurrence (Yes/No)

🛠️ Tech Stack
